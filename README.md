# case-study
The first 3 python scripts (with file names beginning: csv2gpdw...) take 3 files (cities.csv, regions.csv and countries.csv) and upload them to 3 tables in gpdw (Cities, Regions and Countries respectively). The last script (return_cityinfo.py) logs into gpdw, asks the user to input a city, and then outputs all of the information known about this city from the 3 tables.
